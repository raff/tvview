# tvview, Swift edition (macOS + iPad)

A SwiftUI app with a macOS and an iOS/iPadOS target, sharing one codebase. It
reuses the Go app's page scripts and default config **unchanged**: `sidebar.js`,
`settings.js`, `hide.js`, `mediasession.js` and `channels.yaml` are read from the
repo root and copied into the bundle at build time. See `../PORTING.md` for the
reasoning and `../SETTINGS.md` for the settings-panel design.

## Layout

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `TVCore/` | SwiftPM package, no UI: config model, loading, validation (a port of `config.go`). `swift test` runs it. |
| `App/Shared/` | `AppModel` (live state), `WebHost` (the `WKWebView` and the page bridge), `TVViewApp` (scene, commands). |
| `App/macOS/`, `App/iOS/` | The per-platform bits: the `NSViewRepresentable`/`UIViewRepresentable` wrapper, the iOS audio session. |
| `project.yml` | XcodeGen spec. The `.xcodeproj` is generated, not committed. |

## Build and run

```sh
cd swift
xcodegen generate                       # after editing project.yml or adding files
(cd TVCore && swift test)               # config logic

# macOS
xcodebuild -project TVView.xcodeproj -scheme TVView-macOS -derivedDataPath build build
open "build/Build/Products/Debug/TV View.app"

# iPad simulator
xcodebuild -project TVView.xcodeproj -scheme TVView-iOS -derivedDataPath build \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=<an iPad>' CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build
```

Or open `TVView.xcodeproj` in Xcode. To run on a real iPad, set
`DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` in `project.yml` and regenerate.

## Where the config comes from

- **macOS:** same order as the Go app, minus the working directory: iCloud Drive
  `tvview/channels.yaml`, then `~/.config/tvview/channels.yaml`, then the built-in
  default. The app is unsandboxed so it can read those (a Mac App Store build
  would need the sandbox and another location).
- **iOS:** the app's Documents folder (visible in Files), then the built-in
  default. Nothing seeds it yet; iCloud for iOS is not done.

## How the page and the app talk

The sidebar and settings panel run in their own `WKContentWorld`, so the pages
they are injected into cannot see (or call) the bindings. `WebHost` defines each
`window.wvXxx()` in that world as a call to one reply-capable message handler,
which gives the same promise-returning functions go-webview's `Bind` did. Going
the other way, the app runs `window.wvToggleSidebar()` etc. in that world.
`hide.js` and `mediasession.js` stay in the page's world (`navigator.mediaSession`
must be the page's own).

## Status

Working (checked by running both targets): config loading and validation,
channel list in the sidebar, switching channels, last channel remembered, user
agent, per-channel hide selectors, sidebar toggle from the menu (Cmd-\\), the
Channels menu with Cmd-1…9, Reload / Back / Forward, window title.

Not done yet:

- `wvGetConfig` / `wvSaveConfig`, so the Settings button does nothing. Needs the
  save side of `config.go` ported (reconcile `vpn.tunnels`, `.bak`, atomic
  write) with the same golden tests, then the two handlers in `WebHost`.
- Hide selectors and media settings should apply live after a save: re-run
  `install(config:)`.
- VPN: regions load and validate, but no tunnel is raised (needs a
  `NEPacketTunnelProvider` extension; see `../PORTING.md`).
- iCloud config on iOS, the fullscreen/PiP behaviour on a real device, the
  headphone seek behaviour on a real device, an app icon, signing for distribution.
- Wiring `swift test` and a build of both targets into the Makefile.
